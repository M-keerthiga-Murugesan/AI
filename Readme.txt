Energy Consumption Analysis in Electric Vehicles

Project Overview:
-----------------
Problem Statement:
With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, it's crucial to understand and optimize their energy consumption. This project addresses this challenge by analyzing real-world data to identify the factors affecting energy usage and building a predictive model.

Phases of Development:
The project follows a structured approach, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning model development, and model evaluation. It leverages a Random Forest Regression model to predict energy consumption.

Dataset Description:
---------------------
The dataset used in this project consists of data from electric vehicle telematics systems and weather stations, collected over a two-year period. It includes features such as speed, temperature, vehicle make and model, and energy consumption. The dataset is available at [link_to_your_data_source](link_to_your_data_source).

Getting Started:
----------------
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.


2. Install the required dependencies using pip.


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore the data and train the machine learning model.

Data Preprocessing:
-------------------
The data preprocessing phase involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing the data. The code and details of these preprocessing steps are available in the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.

Feature Engineering:
--------------------
Feature engineering includes the creation of an 'interaction' feature that captures the combined effect of speed and temperature on energy consumption. Categorical variables, such as vehicle make and model, are one-hot encoded. You can explore these feature engineering techniques in the feature_engineering.ipynb notebook.

Machine Learning Model:
-----------------------
The project employs a Random Forest Regression model to predict energy consumption. The model_training.ipynb notebook contains the code for model training and hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation:
-----------------
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The evaluation details are available in the model_evaluation.ipynb notebook.
